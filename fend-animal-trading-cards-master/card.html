			<p class="italicize">The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.</p>

			<p>Cats have 30 teeth (dogs have 42) and most of us know how sharp they are.Cats have a reflective layer in their eyes, known as the tapetum lucidum, which magnifies incoming light allowing them to see up to 6 times better than humans can in low light. Cats (as well as dogs) also have a ‘third eyelid’ called the nictitating membrane which is found on the inside corner of the eye which is an extra protective function of the eye.</p>
